******************************

F-AI is an artificial intelligence library for F#, currently in its early stages.

Completed but not robustly tested:
 * kNN
 * Perceptron
 * Decision Tree
 * Noisy-Or Classifier
 * Bayesian Networks
 ** CPT learning from discrete-valued, complete training data
 ** Inference queries using Gibbs sampling
 ** Tree structure learning
 
In progress summer '13:
 * Enhanacements to Bayesian network code.
 ** Structure learning

TBD:
 * k-means clustering
 * PCA
 * GMM
